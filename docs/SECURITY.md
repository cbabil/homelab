# Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the security practices and guidelines for maintaining the security of the homelab setup. It includes recommendations for securing the environment, managing sensitive information, and responding to security incidents.

## Security Practices

### Network Security

- **Use Secure Protocols**: Always use secure protocols such as SSH and HTTPS for communication.
- **Firewall Configuration**: Implement proper firewall rules to restrict access to only necessary services and ports.
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

### Authentication

- **Strong Passwords**: Enforce a strong password policy for all user accounts.
- **Two-Factor Authentication**: Enable two-factor authentication where possible to enhance security.
- **Credential Rotation**: Regularly rotate credentials and access keys to minimize risk.

### System Security

- **Regular Updates**: Keep all systems and software up to date with the latest security patches.
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Perform regular vulnerability scans to identify and address potential security issues.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement system activity logging and security event monitoring to detect suspicious activities.

### Container Security

- **Use Official Images**: Use official and trusted base images for containers.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep container images updated to the latest versions.
- **Minimal Permissions**: Run containers with the least privileges necessary and avoid running containers as root.

### Secrets Management

- **Ansible Vault**: Use Ansible Vault to securely store and manage sensitive information such as passwords and API keys.
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure that sensitive environment variables are not exposed in version control.

## Incident Response

- **Incident Reporting**: Report any security incidents or vulnerabilities to the project maintainers immediately.
- **Response Plan**: Have a response plan in place to address and mitigate security incidents effectively.
