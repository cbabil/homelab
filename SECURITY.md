## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of this homelab infrastructure project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do Not** create a public GitHub issue
2. Send an email to [your-security-email@domain.com]
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

## Security Best Practices

### Secrets Management

1. **Ansible Vault**
   - All sensitive data must be encrypted using Ansible Vault
   - Vault password should be stored securely and never committed to the repository
   - Use `.vault_pass` file for automated processes (ensure it's in .gitignore)

2. **SSH Keys**
   - Never commit unencrypted private keys
   - Use strong passphrases for SSH keys
   - Rotate SSH keys regularly

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Sensitive data in environment files (.env) should never be committed
   - Use .env.example for documentation

### Access Control

1. **Network Security**
   - Use secure protocols (SSH, HTTPS)
   - Implement proper firewall rules
   - Regular security audits

2. **Authentication**
   - Strong password policy
   - Two-factor authentication where possible
   - Regular credential rotation

### System Security

1. **Updates**
   - Regular system updates
   - Security patch management
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning

2. **Monitoring**
   - System activity logging
   - Security event monitoring
   - Regular log review

### Container Security

1. **Docker**
   - Use official base images
   - Regular container updates
   - Proper permission management
   - No sensitive data in container layers

2. **Image Scanning**
   - Regular vulnerability scanning
   - Container image signing
   - Use of minimal base images
